  An in-progress framework for rapid deployment of Telegram bots via shell scripts.
</div>

## Premises

- **Portable.** Telegram Bash Bot Framework arises with the premise of being POSIX compatible, which allows it to be interpreted by the most used shells nowadays.

- **No programming knowledge required.** You only need to know how to manipulate the terminal with ease to be able to run your own bot in a matter of minutes (or less).

- **Minimal but useful.** While the shell may have its limitations compared to more robust programming languages, with TBB your bot can have the core functionalities with much less effort.

*Note that currently Telegram Bash Bot Framework is a work in progress. Some features may not work as expected or may be missing. Any ideas or suggestions are very welcome.*
